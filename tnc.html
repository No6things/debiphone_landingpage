                          1.  Authentication. You may be required to provide additional information or documentation to allow <span class="turquoise">Debiphone</span> to verify your identity and/or your account information. <span class="turquoise">Debiphone</span> may also verify your information against third party databases or other sources and you authorize <span class="turquoise">Debiphone</span> to make such inquiries.</br>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          2.  Validation. At registration you will be required to confirm your Mobile number by entering the Temporary Password sent to your Mobile number via SMS. Once the Application accepts and Validates the Password you are required to finish registering providing your Account login information along with a Memorable word to be used to recover your Password in case you forget it.</br>

                        <li>
                          3.  Password Security. You are responsible for keeping your Account login information, password, and PIN secure. In addition to the Login Password, you will be required to provide two PIN’s, the GREEN PIN and the RED PIN. The GREEN PIN is to be used to accept a Transaction under normal conditions and by your own will. The RED PIN instead is used as a deterrent. It is to be used as an Alert to the System that you are being forced to access your Account Information and make a Transaction. Along with the RED PIN you will need to set your safety balance limit, which you can change yourself at any time. This Safety Balance Limit is the amount that you will show in your Account Balance in the case of a present danger, which we recommend to be a low number but sufficiently realist. If you share your Account credentials with another person, you are responsible for all activity they conduct using your Account, regardless of whether or not you authorized their activity. <span class="turquoise">Debiphone</span> will never ask you for your Account credentials.</br>

These funds being deposited will only be available following the closing of the Compensation Period during which funds were deposited into the User’s VHA.</br></li>
                        <li>7.  Transfer. Any active User can initiate a Transfer request at any time for the amount it deems necessary and up to the limit amount set forth by Debiphone. It is the Recipient’s discretion to accept or reject any such transfer. Recipient may or may not be an active <span class="turquoise">Debiphone</span> User. If Recipient is not an active <span class="turquoise">Debiphone</span> User, he/she will receive an SMS inviting him/her to join in and download the Application in order to be able to have access to such funds being sent to him/her.</br></li>
                        <li>8.  Payment.   When you use the <span class="turquoise">Debiphone</span> Service to make a payment, you are requesting an electronic transfer from your VHA to another <span class="turquoise">Debiphone</span> User’s VHA.  <span class="turquoise">Debiphone</span> will make electronic transfers via the (“ECH”) from your Virtual Holding Account to another User’s VHA at <span class="turquoise">Debiphone</span> in the amount resulting out of the Compensation.  You agree that such requests constitute your authorization to <span class="turquoise">Debiphone</span> to make the transfers.  Once you have provided your authorization for the transfer by entering your Green Code, you will not be able to change it or cancel it. You are responsible for confirming the accuracy of the information you provide about each payment, including the amount of the transaction.</br></li>

It is in the Charged User discretion to accept or reject any such Charge, before the payment is processed. Any User being charged must be a registered and active <span class="turquoise">Debiphone</span> User.</br></li>
                        <li>10.  Currency: All payments occur in the selected Country’s own currency.</br></li>
                        <li>11.  Multiple Bank Accounts. You may link multiple Bank accounts to your <span class="turquoise">Debiphone</span> account; however, only one of those Banks will be activated at any one moment in time.</br></li>

                      X. FEES</br></br>
                      <ul>
                        <li>1.  Transfer Fees. <span class="turquoise">Debiphone</span> does charge the Sender User nor the Recipient a 0.5% (zero point five percent) fee over the transferred amount for the processing of the Compensation Services.</br></li>
                        <li>2.  Charge Fee. The Charged User or Payer in a Charge Transaction does not pay <span class="turquoise">Debiphone</span> any fee for the processing of its payment or for any other purposes. Yet, the Requesting party or Charging User will be charged a similar transaction fee of 0.5% (zero point five percent) for the processing of the Compensation Services. As a result, the Requestor may or may not include this markup to the Payer, plus any other fee both partied have previously agreed upon.</br></li>
                        <li>3.  Reimburse Fees. If a payment that you received and accepted that was not intended to you is subject to a Reversal as set out in Section XII (Transaction reversal), you may be charged a penalty fee equivalent to $50.00 (“Reimburse Fee”) to revert the payment.</br></li>
                        <li>4.  Reversal Fee. Likewise, any Sender that requires a reversal of any given transaction that has been fully executed and authorized will be charged a fee the equivalent to $10.00 (“Reversal Fee”), unless that transaction occurs under a RED Code alert or the User can prove that it was made under “Forced Threat” beyond his/her control. In this case no penalties will be applied to either Sender or Recipient.</br></li>
                        <li>5.  Applicable Fees. The following are all applicable fees which the User is entitled to pay as it applies.</br></li>
                        <ul>
                          <li>I.  Network Connection charges from your Mobile carrier for the use of data transfer, air time, network use or any other form of chargeable restriction applicable to the User’s Mobile account.</br></li>
                          <li>II.  Bank fees as determined by each individual Financial Institution Partner Bank for the use of their services, which may include transferring fees, overdraft penalties and any other as described in the Bank’s own Policies and Procedures.</br></li>
                          <li>III.  Collection Fees as charged by the Recipient which have been previously agreed through a separate individual or collective agreement by and between the Sender and the Recipient for which the transaction media is irrelevant and therefore has no bearing upon <span class="turquoise">Debiphone</span> Services.</ul></li>
                        </ul>
                      </br></br>

                    <li>
                      XI. UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS</br></br>
                      <ul>
                        <li>1. An “Unauthorized Transaction” is a type of error that occurs when a payment is made from your Virtual Holding Account using the <span class="turquoise">Debiphone</span> Service that you did not authorize and that did not benefit you.  For example, an Unauthorized Transaction has occurred when someone steals your <span class="turquoise">Debiphone</span> Service password and uses the password to access your account and make a payment.  On the other hand, if you give someone access to your account (by giving them your login information) and that person makes payments without your knowledge or permission, you are responsible for that use.</br></li>
                        <li>2. Lost Mobile Device. If you lose your mobile device or have it stolen, you should immediately contact our Customer Service department at support@debiphone.com or by phone at +44-333-0143511 and notify us of the incident. Our Customer Service interactive voice response (“IVR”) service will give you the option to report the stolen phone by requesting from you both your Username along with your Memorable word for authentication purposes. At this time any transaction originating from your Mobile number is fully deactivated and the Application is disabled. We may pass on this information to the proper authorities to allow them locate the Phone if it’s intended to be used again.</br></li>
                        <li>3. Investigation. If an Unauthorized Transaction has occurred, your dispute is with the Recipient who received the funds.  You will need to provide supporting documentation that proves your Dispute charges against this person before we can proceed to track down the trail of transaction originating from the funds released with your Authorization from your Virtual Holding Account. We will determine whether an Error occurred within 15 business days after you notify us and will correct it in due time. If we need more time, we may take up to 30 days to investigate. If we decide to do this, we will credit your VHA within 10 business days for the amount of the suspected Error. If we ask you to send your inquiry by email and we do not receive it within 10 business days, we may not credit your VHA. If we decide that there was no Error, we will provide you a written explanation. You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.</br>
                        You should regularly log into the <span class="turquoise">Debiphone</span> Service and review your Bank statements and review your payment history to identify any Unauthorized Transactions.</br></li>
                        <li>4.  Other Errors. Other Errors that are covered by <span class="turquoise">Debiphone</span> are limited to the following events:</br>
                          <ul>
                            <li>I.  if you make a payment for a given amount and the transaction summary reflects a difference;</br></li>
                            <li>II.  if an incorrect amount is credited to your Virtual Holding Account;</br></li>
                            <li>III.  if a transaction is missing from or not properly identified in your transaction history;</br></li>
                            <li>IV.  if there is a computational or mathematical error by <span class="turquoise">Debiphone</span> following a Compensation Clearing process.</br></li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                      </br>

                      XII. TRANSACTION REVERSAL</br></br>
                      <ul>
                        <li>1. Reversals. Any payment that you receive may be reversed if: (a) the sender requests a reversal of the payment and provides proof that he/she sent it by error, (b) you have incorrectly accepted a payment that was not intended to you, or (c) the amount you have received differs from the intended amount that was originally intended to you; or d) <span class="turquoise">Debiphone</span> decides a Dispute against you.</br>
                        You are liable to <span class="turquoise">Debiphone</span> for the full amount of any payment that you receive that is subject to a Reversal, and the Reversal Fee, if applied. You will not receive a refund of any Fee that you may have been applied by either your Mobile Carrier, your Bank or the Sender itself.</br></li>
                        <li>2. Authorization to recover amounts due. You authorize <span class="turquoise">Debiphone</span> to recover any Reversal amounts due to the Sender by debiting your available <span class="turquoise">Debiphone</span> Balance. If you have an insufficient <span class="turquoise">Debiphone</span> Balance, you authorize <span class="turquoise">Debiphone</span> and the Financial Institution Partner to take any of the following actions to recover the remaining amounts from you:</br>
                          <ul>
                            <li>I.  Debit the Bank or Financial Partner Institution account(s) linked to your Virtual Holding Account for the amount to be recovered plus any applicable penalties;</br></li>
                            <li>II.  Suspend your VHA and require your immediate payment; or</br></li>
                            <li>III.  Engage in collection efforts</ul>.</br></br></li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>

                      <ul>
                        <li>1.  Dispute resolution. You understand and agree that <span class="turquoise">Debiphone</span> is not responsible for the goods or services that you pay for using the <span class="turquoise">Debiphone</span> Services. Each person that you pay to is responsible for providing the goods and services that you purchase if any and confirm ahis/her acceptance of the payment being received.

If you have exhausted all options for resolving a dispute with a Recipient, you may choose to file a dispute claim with <span class="turquoise">Debiphone</span> (“Dispute”) by following the steps in Section XIII.3 below.</br></li>
                        <li>2.  Release of Debiphone. By filing a Dispute, you understand and agree that:</br>

                        <li>4.  Disputes with Debiphone.</br></li>
                        <ul>
                          <li>i.  Binding arbitration. You and we (the “Parties") agree that upon the election of either of the Parties, any past, present, or future dispute relating in any way to your Account, or any other past, present, or future relationship or transaction between the Parties, will be resolved by binding arbitration as discussed below, and not through litigation in any court. Such disputes are called "Claims" for purposes of this agreement. This binding agreement to arbitrate applies regardless of whether the dispute is between you and us jointly or separately. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single third party neutral Arbitrator selected by the appointed Arbitrator of each Party. Unless the Parties agree otherwise, or unless the arbitration administrator's rules or law require otherwise, the arbitration shall be held in a place decided by the Neutral Arbitrator</br>
                            <ul>
                              <li>1)  The Arbitrator will decide the Claim in accordance with all applicable law, including recognized principles of equity and statutes of limitations, and will honor all privileges recognized by law. The Arbitrator will have the authority to award to a Party any damages or relief provided for under applicable law. The Arbitrator's decision shall be final and legally binding, and may be enforced by any court having jurisdiction.</br></li>
                              <li>2)  No class actions or similar process, and no joinder or consolidation of any Claim with a Claim of any other person or entity, shall be allowable in arbitration, without the written consent of both Parties. The Arbitrator shall have no authority to entertain any Claim on behalf of a class, group, person, or entity who is not a named party to the arbitration, nor shall any Arbitrator have authority to make any award for the benefit of, or against, any class, group, person, or entity who is not a named party to the arbitration. In the event that there is a dispute about whether limiting arbitration to non-class proceedings, or to the named parties, is enforceable under applicable law, then that question shall be resolved by a court rather than by an Arbitrator; and to the extent it is determined that resolution of a Claim must proceed on a class basis, it shall so proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction rather than in arbitration. If you elect to proceed with respect any Claim by an individual action in a small claims court, or its equivalent, instead of arbitration, we will not object, however, any such action shall be taken in small claims court in our Home base jurisdiction.</br></li>
                              <li>3)  If the Arbitrator or arbitration administrator would impose filing fees or other administrative costs on you, we will reimburse you, upon request, to the extent such fees or costs would exceed those that you would otherwise have to pay if you were proceeding instead in a court. We will also pay additional fees or costs if required to do so by the arbitration administrator's rules or applicable law. Apart from the foregoing, each Party will be responsible for any other fees or costs, such as attorney fees that the Party may incur. If you consider that you are unable to afford any fees or costs that would be yours to pay, you may request that we pay or reimburse them, and we will consider your request in good faith provided that such funds will be repaid by you on a future to agree format.</br></li>
                              <li>4)  Arbitration with respect to a Claim is binding and neither Party will have the right to litigate that Claim through a court. In arbitration the Parties will not have the same rights that apply in court, such as the right to a trial by judge or jury and the right to participate or be represented in proceedings brought by others such as class actions or similar proceedings. In addition, the right to discovery and the right to appeal may also be limited or eliminated in arbitration. All of these judicial rights are waived with respect to Claims that the Parties elect to arbitrate.</li>
